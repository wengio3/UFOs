# Overview of Project

Dana is a data journalist who is working on a project about her home town McMinnville, Oregon. McMinnville is famous for its UFO sightings and even has an annual gathering of UFO enthusiasts. Danas's interest in this topic started as a child when she first heard about farmer Trent's sighting back in 1950. Dana has a JavaScript file filled with sighting information. In this analysis, we use the JavaScript file to display the data as a table. However, because there is so much data to sift through, we have added filters. Finally, we have put everything in an HTML page.
